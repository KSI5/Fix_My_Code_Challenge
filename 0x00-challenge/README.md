This file contains descriptions for the 0x00-challenge project.



File: 1-print_square.js

The original code attempted to print a square using the '#' character. However, there were issues in the implementation, and the square was not being printed as expected. The corrected code now properly prints a square of the specified size using nested loops. The program takes the size of the square as a command-line argument and outputs the square with the '#' character.

2. Sorting Arguments in Ruby
File: sort_args.rb

The original Ruby code attempted to sort integer arguments in ascending order. However, there was an issue in the insertion logic that resulted in incorrect sorting. The corrected code now properly sorts the integer arguments using an insertion approach. The sorted integers are then printed in ascending order.

3. User Class in Python
File: user_class.py

The original Python code defined a User class with password handling capabilities. However, there was an issue in the password setter method, which was not properly updating the private password attribute. The corrected code now correctly hashes the password using MD5 before assigning it to the private attribute. Additionally, the is_valid_password method has been fixed to compare the hashed password with the input password.

4. FizzBuzz in Python
File: fizzbuzz.py

The original Python code attempted to implement the classic FizzBuzz program, which prints numbers from 1 to a given number, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz." However, there was an issue in the conditional checks that led to incorrect results. The corrected code now properly applies the FizzBuzz rules, producing the expected output for the specified range of numbers.
